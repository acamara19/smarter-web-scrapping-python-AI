    "Does it have basic functioning other stuff? I am shocked at how our production usage of Fly has gone. Even basic stuff as support not being able to just... look up internal platform issues. Cryptic/non-existent error messages. I'm not impressed. It feels like it's compelling to those scared of or ignorant of Kubernetes. I thought I was over Kubernetes, but Fly makes me miss it.\n",

Try a `watch -n 2 curl <serviceipv4>` during a deploy to see for yourself (try any one of the the strategies documented including blue-green). I wonder how many people know this?\n",
    "When I tested it I was hoping for at worst early termination of old connections with no dropped new connections and at best I expected them to gracefully wait for old connections to finish.

When I emailed their support, I got an auto-response asking me to post in the forum. Pretty much all hosts are expected to offer a ticket system even for their unmanaged services if its a problem on their side. I just moved over all my stuff to Render.com, it's more expensive, but its been reliable so far.\n",
